# Notificatorro!
Simple and easy quick-note notification app.

#### Features:
- Create notifications with your own text!
- Track history of your notes and clear anytime!
- English and Russian languages are supported for now.
- This app will never track you in any way. It does what it does, nothing more.

#### Future plans:

- !!! fix delayed notifications feature.
- Add clear field and notifications button.
- Add persistent notification feature:
	- Add switcher to show/hide notification.
- dark and light themes.
- history go to top button?
- timestamp in history.
- widget?
- add best experience warning.
- new icons 512x.
- add regular notes (serialisation).
- color notification title + setting.
- add help page.
	- tell about custom roms that cuts big notifications (like MIUI).
- search in history.
- add welcome page.
- alternative in-app notifications.
- try to implement everything as fragments, that will allow you to see drawer everywhere.
- themes.
