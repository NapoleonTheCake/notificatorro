# Notificatorro!
Simple and easy quick-note notification app.

#### Features:
- Create notifications with your own text!
- Track history of your notes and clear anytime!
- English and Russian languages are supported for now.
- This app is minimalistic. It does what it does, nothing more like sending stats in background.

#### Future plans:
- !!! fix delayed notifications feature.
- ! fix app crash when creating quicknote without text in clipboard (see todo flag in code).
- Add clear notifications button.
- Add persistent notification feature:
	- Add switcher to show/hide notification.
	- Configure shortcut to toggle it.
- dark and light themes.
- history go to top button?
- widget?
- add best experience warning.
- add regular notes (serialisation).
- color notification title + setting.
- add help page.
	- tell about custom roms that cuts big notifications (like MIUI).
- search in history.
- add welcome page.
- try to implement everything as fragments, that will allow you to see drawer everywhere.
- timestaps according to user's locale.
- add shortcuts for: persistent activity(disable/enable), history(clear?).
- add shortcut to clear all notifications (and find place to put into <25 api) // create field in settings which is visible only for api>=25.
- add setting to keep title after creating note (pin against clear button?).
- add square-ish icon.
- add pic notes (add capture with camera + tabs on top).
- format text in history? (title, date).
- add colored shortcuts instead of bw.
- quicknote: make alertdialog with transparent activity.
