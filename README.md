Simple and easy quick-note notification app.

#### Features:
- Create notifications with your own text!
- Track history of your notes and clear anytime!
- Create delayed notifications! (Currently broken).
- Create pinned notification to keep stuff in mind!
- Android N+ can use app's shortcuts.
- Android M+ can create quicknotes from selected text.
- English and Russian languages are supported for now.
- This app is minimalistic. It does what it does, nothing more like sending stats in background.

#### Future plans:

- add square-ish icon.
- add pic notes (add capture with camera + tabs on top).
